= Connecting to Veiligvertoon is the easiest way to manage your GHS safety information and comply to CLP regulations for selling products online. =

This plugin allows you to add GHS/CLP safety information and your MSDSs in your WooCommerce store by connecting to the Veiligvertoon database. The plugin itself is available in English and Dutch. The output language of your safety information is available in Dutch, English and German.

As a European web shop owner, you are obliged to show the dangers of a product before the purchase of a product. You do this through hazard statements, precautionary statements and GHS labels. Simply uploading a safety data sheet is not sufficient for this.

Managing all this information, keeping track of when it was last edited, displaying this information nicely on your website and especially retyping the labels quickly becomes a problem when you do this manually.

With Veiligvertoon, creating, managing and styling the display of safety information is easier than ever. When using Veiligvertoon, the safety information of your website looks professional and matches the style of your web shop completely.

For each product, you can upload the supplier's safety data sheet at the push of a button, and the Veiligvertoon reader immediately translates it into the relevant information for the consumer. Don't have the safety data sheet? You can also manually configure the safety information. In our clear product overview you can immediately see for which products the information is live, which ones still need to be supplemented and when you last edited the information. 

= Key Features =
* Personalized styling of safety information
* A clear overview for managing your safety information
* Scan your safety information datasheet (SDS) and automatically convert to relevant information for the consumer
